## Project Overview 
Ecolabels play a pivotal role in guiding consumers towards sustainable purchasing decisions amid the increasing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The current manual process of certifying products for certifications is both timeconsuming and error-prone, posing risks of incorrect certifications and product recalls. We proposed an innovative approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline and enhance the certification process. We will compare the LLM assessments with traditional Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms to evaluate the efficacy of these
models as an Ecolabel recommendation engine.


## Methodology 
Given IT product and certification data, we utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to assess whether a product meets the criteria for an ESG certification
