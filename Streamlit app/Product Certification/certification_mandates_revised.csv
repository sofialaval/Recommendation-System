The u' and v' chromaticity coordinates of the primary colors R, G and B form a triangle in the CIE 1976 uniform chromaticity scale diagram. The larger the area of the triangle, the wider the range of colors the screen is capable of presenting."
TCO,5.5.1,Color uniformity,"The maximum color deviation between measured active areas on the screen that are intended to maintain the same color must be du'v' <= 0.012.
du'v' = sqrt[(u'A - u'B)^2 + (v'A - v'B)^2]"
TCO,5.6.1,Color uniformity - angular dependence,"In landscape mode, the du'v' between areas on the left side and the right side of the screen

TCO,5.8.1,Luminance level,The maximum luminance must be >=150 cd/m2 (candela per square meter).
TCO,5.9.1,Luminance uniformity,"The luminance uniformity is defined as the ratio of maximum to minimum luminance within the fully active screen area. Luminance variation across the active screen, Lmax : Lmin must be <= 1.60."
TCO,5.10.1,Luminance uniformity - angular-dependence,"Luminance uniformity – angular dependence, is the capacity of a display to maintain a certain luminance level irrespective of the viewing direction. The angular-dependent luminance uniformity is defined as the ratio of maximum luminance to minimum luminance in the specified measurement areas. In landscape mode, when the screen is rotated around the vertical axis through the center of the screen the mean value of the Lmax to Lmin ratios at +-15 degrees must be <= 3.00."
TCO,5.11.1,Luminance contrast - characters,"Luminance contrast – characters is the capacity of the display to maintain a high luminance
difference between a bright background and dark characters or parts of characters over the
whole active area. The luminance contrast must be >= 0.70 measured orthogonally to the screen."
TCO,5.12.1,Luminance contrast - angular dependence,"Luminance contrast – angular dependence, is the capability of the Notebook display to
maintain the same contrast regardless of the direction from which the screen is viewed. In landscape mode, the luminance contrast-angular dependence must be >= 0.80 at +- 15 degrees horizontally from the viewing direction (rotated around the vertical axis through the center of the screen)."
TCO,5.13.1,Keyboard gloss,"Gloss is a measure of how a light beam, physically described as luminous flux, is scattered at
the surface when incident against that surface. Gloss is a function of the directional
reflectance properties of a surface. The gloss of the keyboard (keys) must have a gloss value G(60) <= 30 gloss units."
TCO,6.3.1,Standardized connectors,The device must carry at least one USB Type-C connector that is backward compatible with USB 2.0. Products with no connectors are exempted from this criterion. 
TCO,6.4.1,Product durability,"The product must be tested with the modified storage / operational temperature interval and duration as well as the drop test height according to the table below. The results will be reported on the certificate.
