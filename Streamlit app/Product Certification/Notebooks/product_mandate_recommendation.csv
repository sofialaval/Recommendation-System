    If there is not enough information provided, respond with ""MORE INFO NEEDED"" and your reasoning. 
    ","Recommendation: TRUE

Reasoning: 

To assess compliance with TCO Certification Mandate 5.2.1, we need to calculate the pixel density (PPI) based on the given display resolution and diagonal. 

First, we calculate the diagonal in inches: 
Diagonal (in inches) = Display diagonal (in inches) = 14.0""

Then, we calculate the pixel density (PPI) using the formula:
PPI = [sqrt(horizontal pixels^2 + vertical pixels^2)] / diagonal (in inches)

Plugging in the values:
PPI = [sqrt(1920^2 + 1080^2)] / 14.0 ≈ 157.35 PPI

Since the pixel density of the product ""3480"" is 157.35 PPI, which is greater than the required minimum of 100 PPI, the product is compliant with the TCO Certification Mandate 5.2.1 for Display resolution. Therefore, the recommendation is TRUE.",True,GPT-3.5,2023-11-03 10:57:48.581295
